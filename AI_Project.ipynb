        "\n",
        "This notebook develops and evaluates a machine learning model that predicts the risk of stroke using patient demographic, lifestyle, and clinical information. The goal is to build a realistic AI application that can support early identification of high risk individuals and demonstrate the full pipeline from data preprocessing to deployment in Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and long term disability worldwide. Many of its risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, and uncontrolled glucose, are modifiable. A data driven risk prediction model can help clinicians and health systems focus attention on patients who are more likely to benefit from closer monitoring and preventive interventions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project follows the requirements of the final assignment:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define a real world problem that can be addressed with machine learning.\n",
        "- Select a suitable dataset from an online repository.\n",
        "- Explore and preprocess the data.\n",
        "- Select, train, and tune appropriate models.\n",
        "- Evaluate performance using relevant metrics.\n",
        "- Add explainability and basic fairness checks.\n",
        "- Deploy the model within Colab through a simple interactive interface.\n",

        "   - Because this category is extremely rare, it can complicate modeling without adding meaningful information.  \n",
        "   - I remove rows with `gender == \"Other\"` to keep only `\"Male\"` and `\"Female\"` categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **BMI type conversion and missing values**  \n",
        "   - The `bmi` column is stored as text and may contain non numeric values.  \n",
        "   - I convert `bmi` to numeric using `pd.to_numeric` and coerce invalid entries to `NaN`.  \n",
        "   - I then impute missing `bmi` values using the median BMI, which is a robust choice that is not overly influenced by extreme values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dropping identifier column**  \n",
        "   - The `id` column is a simple identifier and does not contain predictive information.  \n",
        "   - I drop the `id` column from the dataset to avoid accidentally using it as a feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "After these steps, I verify that there are no remaining missing values in the features that will be used for modeling.\n"

        "To understand how the tuned Random Forest makes predictions, I use **SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)**. SHAP provides a consistent way to attribute the prediction of a model to each feature for each instance.\n",

        "\n",
        "- SHAP values estimate how much each feature contributes to moving the model prediction away from a baseline value.  \n",
        "- Positive SHAP values push the prediction toward a higher probability of stroke.  \n",
        "- Negative SHAP values push the prediction toward a lower probability of stroke.\n",

        "1. Fit a `TreeExplainer` on the tuned Random Forest.  \n",
        "2. Compute SHAP values for a sample of training observations.  \n",
        "3. Produce a **summary plot** (beeswarm) that shows:\n",
        "   - The relative importance of each feature.  \n",
        "   - The direction of effect (high values vs low values).  \n",
        "   - The distribution of SHAP values across the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "This global view helps identify which features the model relies on most when predicting stroke risk, such as age, average glucose level, BMI, hypertension, and heart disease.\n"

        "- Assessed performance on a held out test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.  \n",
        "- Applied SHAP and LIME to explain the global and local behavior of the tuned model.  \n",
        "- Performed a simple fairness analysis by gender using the fairlearn library.  \n",
        "- Deployed the final model inside Google Colab using an interactive widget for patient level predictions.\n",
